        <h2>About asmgarden</h2>
        <p>Asm Garden, or assembly garden, is best described as leetcode-for-assembly. Running a competetive coding platform, and a nice UI around it is wasteful - given my assumption that if you end up here, you don't care much about coding interview rounds or competing with other people who leetcode. For that reason, how you'll work through this is run a local docker image provided below, and then run a command to check if you assembly code is correct. The questions will start at hello world, and have things like writing a small game, building GUI, a simple HTTP protocol, some cryptopals-esque problems, a few questions from Euler, and more. You can contribute by going to the github linked below.</p>
        
        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <p>First, you need to have Docker installed. Then, you can run the following command to start the asmgarden container:</p>
